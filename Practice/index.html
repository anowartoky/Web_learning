            <h3>About islamic musics</h3>
            <p>Islamic music may refer to religious music, as performed in Islamic public services or private devotions,
            or more generally to musical traditions of the Muslim world. The heartland of Islam is the Middle East,
            North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Balkans, and West Africa, Iran, Central    Asia, and South Asia. Due to
            Islam being a multi-ethnic religion, the musical expression of its adherents is vastly diverse.
            Indigenous traditions of various part have influenced the musical styles popular among Muslims today.

                <p>In the vast digital landscape, where websites were like sprawling cities, lived a tiny, unassuming

                    designed to seamlessly embed another webpage within a larger one, acting as a window to a different

                    <h4>Sum info about React.js</h4>
                    React.js, more commonly known as React, is a free, open-source JavaScript library. It works best to build user interfaces by combining sections of code (components) into full websites. Originally built by Facebook, Meta and the open-source community now maintain it. One of the good things about React is that you can use it as much or as little as you want! For example, you can build your entire site in React or just use one single React component on one page.
                    React.js is built using JSX – A combination of JavaScript and XML. Elements are created using JSX, then use JavaScript to render them on your site. While React has a steep learning curve for a junior developer, it’s quickly shaping into one of the most popular and in-demand JavaScript libraries.
                    React is considered a JavaScript library rather than a framework, whereas the other options we’ll consider today are considered frameworks. It helps to think of a library as a tool that developers could use in any project and a framework as a whole design.

                        They’d been friends for years, but everything changed for Austin Mullins and Jack Richards, both from the US, when they took a trip to New York’s Fire Island together back in 2020.
                        
                        Returning to NYC very much a couple, the pair moved in together and got engaged two years later.
                        
                        In January 2023, Austin and Jack, who first met at a party back in 2016, relocated from the Big Apple to Uruguay.
                        
                        They’ve been living there happily for the past two years and are now permanent residents of the South American country.</p>

                    <p>“We love it here and find it to be a really special place,” says Austin.

                    So why did this thirty-something couple decide to relocate to one of the smallest countries in South America?
                    
                    Austin and Jack say it all began during the pandemic, when they spent a lot of time watching TV together at their apartment.
                    
                    “We got addicted to a television show called ‘Escape to the Chateau,’” says Jack. “Most of our American friends had never heard of it.”
                    
                    As they continually tuned into the British reality show, which is centered around a couple who buy and renovate a 19th-century French chateau, Austin and Jack became intrigued by the idea of “buying some crumbly old piece of property and renovating it.”
                    
                    However, living in a rural town “didn’t sound appealing.”</p>
